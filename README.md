# PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER

**Overview**

During my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a password complexity checker in Python. This tool evaluates the strength of passwords based on predefined criteria, providing feedback on their security and robustness.

**Key Features**

**Complexity Assessment:** 

The checker evaluates passwords against various complexity criteria, including length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. This ensures that passwords meet recommended security standards.

**Feedback Mechanism:** 

Users receive immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords. The tool highlights areas for improvement and suggests ways to enhance password security.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Complexity Criteria:**

The password complexity checker assesses passwords based on several factors:

Length: Passwords are evaluated for minimum length requirements.

Uppercase Letters: Checks for the presence of uppercase letters.

Lowercase Letters: Ensures that at least one lowercase letter is included.

Digits: Verifies the inclusion of numerical digits.

Special Characters: Checks for the presence of special characters such as !, @, #, etc.

**Strength Evaluation:**

The tool assigns a strength score to passwords based on how well they meet the complexity criteria. This score helps users understand the relative security of their passwords and encourages the creation of stronger, more secure passwords.

**Educational Value:**

Implementing a password complexity checker provides insights into best practices for password security and highlights the importance of creating strong, secure passwords. It serves as a practical example of how password policies can be enforced programmatically.

**Practical Applications:**

The checker is valuable for personal use and can be integrated into applications or systems that require user authentication. It helps ensure that users create passwords that are resilient to common attacks and adhere to security standards.
Ethical Considerations
The password complexity checker is designed for educational and practical purposes, demonstrating the importance of password security. It is essential to use such tools responsibly and to consider user privacy and data protection in any real-world application.
